# Simple React Data Table

This simple one page app fetches data from an external API and renders a data table (a football league table in this instance)

The data can be reordered using the sort buttons (by 'goal difference, initially), and reset to it's initial sort.  

To run locally 

`npm install`

`npm run start`
